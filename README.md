Virtual Piano with SFML

A simple virtual piano application built using SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). This program simulates a piano with 12 keys (7 white keys and 5 black keys) and plays corresponding sounds when the user clicks on the keys.
Features

    7 White Keys: Representing natural notes (C, D, E, F, G, A, B).
    5 Black Keys: Representing sharp notes (C#, D#, F#, G#, A#).
    Mouse Interaction: Click on the white and black keys to play corresponding piano sounds.
    Audio Files: Each key is associated with a .wav sound file.

Requirements

    SFML Library: Ensure you have SFML installed on your system.
    Audio Files: This project uses .wav files for each key. Ensure the sound files are correctly named and placed in the project directory.
        The files should be named: piano_key_0.wav, piano_key_1.wav, ..., piano_key_11.wav.
    C++ Compiler: A compatible C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang).

Installation
1. Install SFML

Follow the official SFML installation guide for your platform:

2. Compile the Project

To compile the project, you need to link the SFML libraries. Here's an example of how you can compile and link the program with g++:

g++ -o virtual_piano main.cpp -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-audio

3. Run the Program

Once compiled, run the program:

./virtual_piano

How to Use

    Start the Application: The application will open a window with a virtual piano layout.
    Play the Piano: Click on any white or black key to play the sound associated with it.
    Close the Application: Click the close button of the window to exit the program.

File Structure

/virtual_piano
|-- main.cpp                # Main C++ source code
|-- README.md               # Project README file
|-- piano_key_0.wav         # Sound file for the first white key (C)
|-- piano_key_1.wav         # Sound file for the second white key (D)
|-- ...                     # Additional sound files for the rest of the keys
|-- piano_key_11.wav        # Sound file for the last black key (A#)

Sound Files

Make sure that you have the following .wav files in your project folder:

    piano_key_0.wav -> C (white key)
    piano_key_1.wav -> D (white key)
    piano_key_2.wav -> E (white key)
    piano_key_3.wav -> F (white key)
    piano_key_4.wav -> G (white key)
    piano_key_5.wav -> A (white key)
    piano_key_6.wav -> B (white key)
    piano_key_7.wav -> C# (black key)
    piano_key_8.wav -> D# (black key)
    piano_key_9.wav -> F# (black key)
    piano_key_10.wav -> G# (black key)
    piano_key_11.wav -> A# (black key)

Troubleshooting

    No sound: Make sure you have the .wav sound files correctly named and placed in the same directory as the executable.
    Missing SFML libraries: Ensure youâ€™ve correctly linked SFML during the compilation.
